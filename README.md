# Machine_Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, machine learning systems learn from data, identifying patterns and making decisions based on those patterns.
